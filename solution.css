The corrected CSS code ensures the path to the `background.jpg` image is accurate.  Consider using relative paths carefully, or switch to absolute paths for more reliability.  Always double-check that the image file exists in the specified location.

```css
/* Corrected path, assuming the image is in the same directory */
.element {
  background-image: url('background.jpg');
}

/* Absolute path for better reliability */
/*.element {
  background-image: url('/images/background.jpg');
}*/
```
